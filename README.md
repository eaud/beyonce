### Beyonce
v1 created Nov. 2015.

## This is a simple memory game that chronicles the trials and tribulations of becoming Beyonc√©.  

Created with simple JS/JQuery, CSS, & HTML.

To play, match Bey's famous moves - but watch out: Michelle is lurking in there somewhere ready to ruin the whole number.  Trials are timed.  Play with two friends and get the lowest time.

I made this project to practice javascript basics.

Lessons learned:
- DOM manipulation
- Simple JS state management
- Extra practice with CSS

Future improvement:
- Pre-cache images to diminish lag in loadtime on tile click.
- Reconfigure tile logic to eliminate the potential to cheat the game by checking the inspector :)
