### BeBeyonce
v1 created Nov. 2015.

## BeBeyonce(Working Title) is a memory game that chronicles the trials and tribulations of becoming Beyonc√©.

I made this project to practice javascript basics.

Lessons learned:
- DOM manipulation
- Simple JS state management
- Extra practice with CSS

Future improvement:
- Pre-cache images to diminish lag in loadtime on tile click.
- Reconfigure tile logic to eliminate the potential to cheat the game by checking the inspector :)
